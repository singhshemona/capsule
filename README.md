# Build My Capsule 
## What is this?
For those of you who prefer traveling light but still want to express your style. Build My Capsule allows you to enter your place of destination and a timeframe. In return, it gives you around 7 essential wardrobe pieces to pack along with enough outfit ideas for your timeframe that can be put together from the 5 pieces.

Potential next steps: allow users to upload pictures of their 20-25 most worn pieces. You can categorize which each item would fall under (top, bottom, accessory, etc). Then the app would return ideal pieces to pack and potential outfits *from your own closet* instead of pre-built staples. Also allow for vacations up to 30 days.
